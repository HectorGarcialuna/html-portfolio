<h3>Planeta del Tesoro | Treasure Planet</h3>
<p>
    I love this disney picture beacuse it involves the perfect combination between sea and air. As well, as teamwork and the very cool story about intergalactic voyage with a story alongside of JIm 
    who is a young man which I identify myself with and how he wants to do what he wants but often he is not understood.

<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>
    I love Air force movies, I love this movie beacuse t has great soundtracks, great air scenes and one pf my dreams is to become a pilot for a hobbie.
